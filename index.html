                        even usain bolt would have given up runing from his problems. So why dont you just <strong>solve them</strong>? Every single psycologist i ve ever asked told me, that it would be a nightmare avoiding that stress.

                        promlems are in our everyday routine and we just have to learn how to solve them instead of trying to avoiding them
